CASE-1


const source = timer(1000); //emit 0 after 1 second then complete, since no second argument is supplied
const subscribe = source.subscribe(val => console.log(val));

//output: 0



CASE-2


const source = timer(1000, 2000);
const subscribe = source.subscribe(val => console.log(val));

//output: 0,1,2,3,4,5......

  timer takes a second argument, how often to emit subsequent values
  in this case we will emit first value after 1 second and subsequent
  values every 2 seconds after
